Although the underlying physical mechanism of the search remains largely unknown, such search paths are usually modeled by some type of random walk. Here, we introduce the stochastic pursuit-evasion equations that consider the bidirectional interaction between predators and prey. This assumption results in a modulated persistent random walk that is characterized by three interesting properties: power-law or tempered power-law distributed running times, superdiffusive or transient superdiffusive dynamics, and strong directional persistence. Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits a transition from Brownian to Lévy-like motion with intensifying predator–prey interaction. Interestingly, persistent random walks with pure-power law distributed running times emerge at the limit of highest predator–prey interaction. We hypothesize that the system ultimately self-organizes into a critical interaction to avoid extinction.","tags":["Animal foraging","Pursuit-evasion games","Persistent random walks","Tempered power-law distributions","Transient superdiffusion","Directional persistence"],"title":"Stochastic pursuit-evasion curves for foraging dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1616795056,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616795056,"objectID":"1a2354399106d069c5463a55830d58b7","permalink":"http://www.math.wsu.edu/math/faculty/nvoul/post/congratulations-sharon-annie-chris/","publishdate":"2021-03-26T14:44:16-07:00","relpermalink":"/math/faculty/nvoul/post/congratulations-sharon-annie-chris/","section":"post","summary":"Sharon Veerayah will work at Amazon Web Services (AWS) as Research Scientist II, Annie Lu will join the Department of Theoretical Physics at the Technical University of Berlin, and Chris Kang will work with the Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos National Laboratory","tags":[],"title":"Congratulations to Sharon, Annie, and Chris for receiving summer internship offers!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Lynn Schreyer","Nikos Voulgarakis","Zachary Hilliard","Sergey Lapin","Loren Cobb"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"1e5bb54243bb269a7a91c9673ac01a25","permalink":"http://www.math.wsu.edu/math/faculty/nvoul/publication/bibtex/content/publication/doi-10-1137-19-m-130056-x/","publishdate":"2022-05-12T16:06:32.231146Z","relpermalink":"/math/faculty/nvoul/publication/bibtex/content/publication/doi-10-1137-19-m-130056-x/","section":"publication","summary":" Recent developments in the continuum mechanics methods for flow through porous media offer some unexpected benefits for modeling the flow of refugees during complex humanitarian emergencies as they move between locations.

The system is decomposed into the fluid domain and the catalyst-fluid interface. We implemented the fluctuating hydrodynamics framework to model the diffusion of the chemical species in the fluid domain, and the chemical master equation to describe the catalytic activity at the interface. The coupling between the domains occurs simultaneously. Using a simple one-dimensional (1D) linear model, we showed that the predictions of our scheme are in excellent agreement with deterministic simulations. The method was specifically developed to model the spatially asymmetric catalysis on the surface of self-propelled nanoswimmers. Numerical simulations showed that our approach can estimate the uncertainty in the swimming velocity resulting from inherent stochastic nature of the chemical reactions at the catalytic interface. Although the method has been applied to simple 1D and 2D models, it can be generalized to handle different geometries and more sophisticated chemical reactions. Therefore, it can serve as a practical mathematical tool to study how the efficiency of chemically powered nanomachines is affected by the interplay between structural complexity, nonlinear reactivity, and nonequilibrium fluctuations.","tags":null,"title":"A hybrid fluctuating hydrodynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo method for modeling chemically-powered nanoscale motion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nikolaos K.

The present study investigates how the interplay between DNA allostery and electrostatic interactions affects protein clustering. The statistical analysis of a simple but transparent computational model reveals two major consequences of this interplay. First, depending on the protein and salt concentration, protein filaments exhibit a bimodal DNA stiffening and softening behavior. Second, within a certain domain of the control parameters, electrostatic interactions can cause energetic frustration that forces proteins to assemble in rigid spiral configurations. Such spiral filaments might trigger both positive and negative supercoiling, which can ultimately promote gene compaction and regulate the promoter. It has been experimentally shown that bacterial histone-like proteins assemble in similar spiral patterns and/or exhibit the same bimodal behavior. The proposed model can, thus, provide computational insights into the physical mechanisms used by proteins to control the mechanical properties of the DNA.

Motivated by the two-grid method for deterministic partial differential equations (PDEs) introduced by Xu (1994), our two-level stochastic collocation method utilizes a two-grid finite element discretization in the physical space and a two-level collocation method in the random domain. In particular, we solve semilinear equations on a coarse mesh TH with a low level stochastic collocation (corresponding to the polynomial space PP) and solve linearized equations on a fine mesh Th using high level stochastic collocation (corresponding to the polynomial space Pp). We prove that the approximated solution obtained from this method achieves the same order of accuracy as that from solving the original semilinear problem directly by stochastic collocation method with Th and Pp. The two-level method is computationally more efficient than the standard stochastic collocation method for solving nonlinear problems with random coefficients.

The free energy of the system consists of two competing terms: (1) a Landau–Lifshitz functional that models the spontaneous separation of the ionic groups, and (2) the standard mean-field electrostatic interaction between the ions in the liquid. The numerical approach used to solve the resulting FHD-Poisson equations is very efficient and models thermal fluctuations with remarkable accuracy. Such density fluctuations are sufficiently strong to excite the experimentally observed spontaneous formation of liquid nano-domains. Statistical analysis of our simulations provides quantitative information about the properties of ionic liquids, such as the mixing quality, stability, and the size of the nano-domains. Our model, thus, can be adequately parameterized by directly comparing our prediction with experimental measurements and all-atom simulations. Conclusively, this work can serve as a practical mathematical tool for testing various theories and designing more efficient mixtures of ionic liquids.","tags":["Mathematical modeling","Mean field theory","Fluctuating hydrodynamics","Interfacial nanostructure","Room temperature ionic liquids","Electrical double layer"],"title":"Fluctuating hydrodynamics for ionic liquids","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nikolaos K.

Zero temperature calculations have been reported previously showing the existence of critical electric field, Ecr, where the system transitions from a stable polaron motion to a Bloch-like oscillation. In this study, we further report that for intermediate polaron sizes the lifetime of such Bloch-like oscillations decay with time due to excessive phonon emission. Our numerical simulations show that the value of Ecr is finite for small temperatures. However, Ecr rapidly decreases with increasing T and becomes practically zero for TTcr. In this small but finite temperature window, we report how temperature affects (a) the electric current density, and (b) the Bloch-like frequencies.","tags":["Holstein model","Polaron mobility","Thermal fluctuations","Bloch oscillation","Langevin dynamics"],"title":"The effect of thermal fluctuations on Holstein polaron dynamics in electric field","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1433195056,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464817456,"objectID":"ff4b5f39b61652a159a1dd3fd5d53d6a","permalink":"http://www.math.wsu.edu/math/faculty/nvoul/post/congratulations-logan/","publishdate":"2015-06-01T14:44:16-07:00","relpermalink":"/math/faculty/nvoul/post/congratulations-logan/","section":"post","summary":"Logan Wickham received the 2015-2016 Auvil Fellowship","tags":[],"title":"Congratulations, Logan!","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1427751856,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1427751856,"objectID":"d9b838aab24a0903832d18c603f3bd80","permalink":"http://www.math.wsu.edu/math/faculty/nvoul/post/congratulations-daniel-ii/","publishdate":"2015-03-30T14:44:16-07:00","relpermalink":"/math/faculty/nvoul/post/congratulations-daniel-ii/","section":"post","summary":"Daniel Herrera won the first award in \"Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, and Information Sciences\" category at SURCA 2014","tags":[],"title":"Congratulations, Daniel!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Joseph J.

Here, we show that the coalescence of protein-induced DNA bubbles can mediate allosteric interactions that drive protein aggregation. We propose that such allostery may regulate DNA's flexibility and the assembly of the transcription machinery. Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), a dual-function protein involved in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) packaging and transcription initiation, is an ideal candidate to test such a hypothesis owing to its ability to locally unwind the double helix. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the coalescence of TFAM-induced bubbles can explain experimentally observed TFAM oligomerization. The resulting melted DNA segment, approximately 10 base pairs long, around the joints of the oligomers act as flexible hinges, which explains the efficiency of TFAM in compacting DNA. Since mitochondrial polymerase (mitoRNAP) is involved in melting the transcription bubble, TFAM may use the same allosteric interaction to both recruit mitoRNAP and initiate transcription.","tags":null,"title":"Allostery through protein-induced DNA bubbles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huan Lei","Christopher J.

The secondary structure of the β-sheet proteins is modelled by a two-dimensional oscillator network whose constituents represent peptide units.  Covalent and hydrogen bonds between the peptide units are represented by point-point interaction potentials.  Intrapeptide vibrational degrees of freedom are taken into account by means of harmonic oscillators while the electronic motion is described within the framework of a tight-binding system.  We construct polarons as stationary localized solution states utilizing a non-linear map approach.  The polaron state represents a self-trapped electron in conjunction with its intrapeptide deformation field and the static deformation of the protein scaffolding.  Furthermore, in the dynamical study we focus attention on the initiation of polaron motion, utilizing its pinning modes.  We show that both the covalent and the hydrogen channel provide a path for coherent ET in β-sheet proteins.  It is demonstrated that the interplay of the vibrations of the protein scaffolding and the electron dynamics promotes long-lived localized excitation patterns travelling coherently along the lattice of peptide units.","tags":null,"title":"Polaronic electron transfer in $p̆beta$-sheet protein models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N.
